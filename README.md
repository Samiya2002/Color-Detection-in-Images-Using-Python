## Description

This project is a Python-based solution for detecting and analyzing colors in images. It leverages popular libraries such as OpenCV, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to process images, identify dominant colors, and visualize the results. Color detection in images has various practical applications, including image processing, design, and content analysis.

## Features

- **Image Processing:** The project uses OpenCV to load and process images, allowing users to work with various image formats.

- **Color Clustering:** It applies the K-Means clustering algorithm from scikit-learn to group similar colors in the image. The number of clusters can be configured as needed.

- **Color Visualization:** The detected colors are presented visually through pie charts, showing the distribution of colors in the image.

- **Hex Color Codes:** The project also provides hexadecimal color codes for each detected color.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Installation:** Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
